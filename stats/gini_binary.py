    Gini impurity calculator for binary variables;
    First step is to define all possible values (x) which could be decision making.
    s_l and s_r are the two new states for <x< (called left and right here)
    w_l and w_r are the weights or the sizes of the new states
    t_l and t_r are the number of identifiers of type 1 in each of the states
    f_l and f_r are the number of identifiers of type 0 in each of the states
    Gini impurity is calculated for both states - gi_l and gi_r
    The result for the given value of decision is the weighted average of gi_l,gi_r with w_l,w_r
    The minimum impurity (cost) is chosen minimising disorder, and a decision making value is returned.
